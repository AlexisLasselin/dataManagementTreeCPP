# dataManagementTreeCPP

- Work in team of two!

- Build a data management solution, similar to the first exercise, based on BSTs (Binary Search Trees)!
  - You can use an auxiliary data structure too...

- Supported Actions: Search/Retrieval, Insertion, Deletion

- The tree should be self-balancing!
  - what data should you store inside it?
